## Why Piano?

- **Complete instrument** — you can play bass, chords, and melody simultaneously
- **Visual layout** — notes are arranged in a clear, repeating pattern
- **Foundation for music theory** — nearly all theory is taught at the piano
- **No tuning needed** — press a key and the correct pitch sounds instantly

In this course, you will learn to read music, develop proper technique, and build a solid foundation that will serve you for years to come. Every concept is introduced step-by-step, with nothing assumed.

## What You Will Need

- A piano or keyboard with **at least 61 keys** (full-size recommended)
- Weighted or semi-weighted keys are ideal for building proper finger strength
- A comfortable bench or chair at the correct height`,

## The Two-Three Pattern

This is the single most important visual landmark on the piano:

- **Group of 2 black keys** — then a gap
- **Group of 3 black keys** — then a gap
- This pattern repeats across the entire keyboard

Every piano, from a small 61-key to a full 88-key grand, uses this exact same pattern. Once you can spot the groups of 2 and 3, you can find any note instantly.

## White Keys

There are **7 white keys** in each repeating group, named after the first seven letters of the alphabet:

**A — B — C — D — E — F — G**

After G, the pattern starts over at A again.

## Black Keys

The black keys are named relative to the white keys next to them. We will learn their names (sharps and flats) in a later module. For now, just notice their grouping pattern.`,

        content: `## What Is an Octave?

An **octave** is the distance from one note to the next note with the same name. For example, from one C to the very next C (going right/higher) is one octave.

The word "octave" comes from the Latin *octo* meaning **eight** — because it spans 8 white keys (counting both the starting and ending note).

## The Repeating Pattern

The piano keyboard is simply the **same 12 keys repeated** over and over:

- 7 white keys (A B C D E F G)
- 5 black keys (in groups of 2 and 3)

Each repetition is one octave. A standard piano has **7 complete octaves** plus a few extra keys.

## Higher and Lower

- Moving **right** on the keyboard = **higher** pitch
- Moving **left** on the keyboard = **lower** pitch

The same note in a higher octave sounds "brighter" — it is the same note name, just at a higher frequency.

## Finding Octaves

Pick any key on the keyboard. Count 8 white keys to the right (including the one you started on). You have arrived at the same note, one octave higher. Try clicking different keys on the keyboard above to hear how octaves sound.`,

## Bench Position

1. Sit on the **front half** of the bench — do not lean against a backrest
2. Your feet should be **flat on the floor**, slightly apart
3. Sit at a height where your **forearms are roughly parallel** to the keyboard or slope very slightly downward
4. Position yourself so that **middle C** is approximately centered in front of your body

## Hand Shape

This is critical — the curved hand shape is the foundation of all piano technique:

1. Let your arms hang loosely at your sides
2. Notice the **natural curve** of your fingers — this is your playing shape
3. Place your hands on the keys maintaining this curve
4. Imagine holding a small ball or an egg under each hand
5. Your **fingertips** (not the flat pads) contact the keys
6. Keep your **knuckles slightly raised** — never let them collapse flat

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Flat fingers** — collapsing the knuckle arch kills your control
- **Raised shoulders** — tension travels from shoulders to fingertips
- **Sitting too close or too far** — your elbows should be slightly in front of your body
- **Locked wrists** — wrists should be flexible, not rigid`,

## The System

Both hands use the **same numbering**:

| Finger | Number |
| ------ | ------ |
| Thumb | **1** |
| Index finger | **2** |
| Middle finger | **3** |
| Ring finger | **4** |
| Pinky | **5** |

The numbering is **mirrored** — on your right hand, finger 1 (thumb) is on the left side; on your left hand, finger 1 (thumb) is on the right side. Both thumbs are always "1".

## Why Fingering Matters

- **Efficiency** — correct fingering lets you play passages smoothly without awkward jumps
- **Consistency** — the same passage should always use the same fingers
- **Speed** — proper fingering is the foundation of playing fast
- **Injury prevention** — fighting against natural finger motion causes strain

In sheet music, you will see small numbers written above or below notes. These are **fingering suggestions** and you should follow them, especially as a beginner.

## Practice: Finger Taps

Place your right hand on a flat surface with curved fingers. Tap each finger one at a time while saying its number aloud: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5" then back "5, 4, 3, 2, 1". Repeat with your left hand.`,

The musical alphabet uses only the first **7 letters**: **A B C D E F G**

After G, it cycles back to A:

... E F G **A** B C D E F G **A** B C D ...

This cycle repeats across the entire keyboard. Each white key has one of these seven names.

## Finding C — Your Home Base

**C** is the most important note to find first. Here is how:

1. Look for a **group of 2 black keys**
2. The white key **immediately to the left** of the group of 2 is **C**

Every group of 2 black keys has a C to its left. There are multiple C notes across the keyboard — each one is in a different octave.

## Finding the Rest

Once you have found C, the other notes follow in order going right:

**C — D — E — F — G — A — B — C**

Here is another landmark: **F** is always the white key **immediately to the left** of the group of **3** black keys.

## Step by Step

1. Find a **group of 2 black keys** near the middle of your keyboard
2. The white key to the **left** of those 2 black keys is **C**
3. The white key **between** the 2 black keys is **D**
4. The white key to the **right** of the 2 black keys is **E**

## Keyboard Sizes and How to Find YOUR Middle C

Not all keyboards have the same number of keys. Here is how to find Middle C on each size:

| Keyboard | Keys | Octaves | Middle C location |
| -------- | ---- | ------- | ----------------- |
| **Full piano** | 88 | 7¼ | The **4th C** from the left (key 40) |
| **76-key** | 76 | 6⅓ | The **3rd C** from the left, roughly center |
| **61-key** | 61 | 5 | The **3rd C** from the left, exactly center |
| **49-key** | 49 | 4 | The **3rd C** from the left |

### Quick method for ANY keyboard:

1. Find the **exact center** of your keyboard
2. Look for the **group of 2 black keys** closest to center
3. The white key to the **left** of that group is **Middle C**

On an 88-key piano, Middle C is slightly left of center. On a 61-key keyboard, it is right in the middle. The important thing is: **Middle C is always C4** regardless of your keyboard size.

### How many octaves does your keyboard have?

Count the number of C keys (left of each group-of-2 black keys). The number of gaps between consecutive C keys is your number of octaves. A full piano has C1 through C8.

## Middle C

The C closest to the center of your keyboard is called **Middle C** (also written as **C4** in scientific notation). This is the most referenced note in all of piano music. It sits right in the middle — between where your left hand and right hand will typically play.

## Try It!

Click on the keyboard diagram above to find and hear C, D, and E. Then try it on your own piano:

1. Play C with your **right hand thumb (finger 1)**
2. Play D with your **right hand index finger (finger 2)**
3. Play E with your **right hand middle finger (finger 3)**

Play them slowly: C — D — E — D — C. Congratulations — you have just played your first notes!

## Naming Notes with Octave Numbers

Musicians label notes with both the letter name and an octave number:

- **C4** = Middle C (4th octave)
- **C5** = the C one octave higher
- **C3** = the C one octave lower

The number goes up each time you pass C going to the right.`,

## Setting Up C Position — Right Hand

1. Find **Middle C** (to the left of the 2 black keys near the center)
2. Place your **right hand thumb (finger 1)** on Middle C
3. Place each remaining finger on the next white key:
   - Finger 1 → **C**
   - Finger 2 → **D**
   - Finger 3 → **E**
   - Finger 4 → **F**
   - Finger 5 → **G**

Each finger covers exactly one key. No stretching, no gaps.

## Important Checkpoints

- **Curved fingers** — maintain the "holding an egg" shape
- **Fingertips on keys** — not flat pads
- **Relaxed wrist** — not dropped below key level, not arched above
- **Thumb plays on its side** — the corner of the nail, not the flat pad

## Your First Five-Note Pattern

Play each note slowly, one at a time, going up and then back down:

**C — D — E — F — G — F — E — D — C**

Say the note names out loud as you play. This trains your brain to connect the finger movement with the note name.

## Setting Up C Position — Left Hand

1. Find the **C one octave below Middle C** (this is C3)
2. Place your **left hand pinky (finger 5)** on this C
3. Place each remaining finger on the next white key going right:
   - Finger 5 → **C**
   - Finger 4 → **D**
   - Finger 3 → **E**
   - Finger 2 → **F**
   - Finger 1 (thumb) → **G**

Notice the **mirroring**: on the right hand, the thumb starts on C. On the left hand, the pinky starts on C. The finger numbers go in opposite directions, but the note names go the same way (C-D-E-F-G left to right).

## Left Hand Five-Note Pattern

Play the same pattern with your left hand:

**C — D — E — F — G — F — E — D — C**

Remember:
- Finger **5** plays C (pinky)
- Finger **4** plays D
- Finger **3** plays E
- Finger **2** plays F
- Finger **1** plays G (thumb)

## Common Left Hand Challenges

- The **ring finger (4) and pinky (5)** are naturally weaker — give them extra attention
- Maintain the **same curved shape** as your right hand
- The left hand will feel less coordinated at first — this is completely normal

## The Quarter Note 𝅘𝅥

- A **filled (black) oval** with a **stem**
- Duration: **1 beat**
- This is the basic unit of time in most music
- When you tap your foot to music, each tap is typically one beat = one quarter note

In 4/4 time, there are **4 quarter notes per measure**.

- An **open (white) oval** with a **stem**
- Duration: **2 beats**
- Hold it for **twice as long** as a quarter note
- In 4/4 time, there are **2 half notes per measure**

## How to Count

When practicing, count out loud:

- **Quarter notes**: "1, 2, 3, 4" (each number = one note)
- **Half notes**: "1—2, 3—4" (each note lasts for two counts)

## Stems

- Notes **below the middle line** of the staff have stems going **up** (on the right side)
- Notes **on or above the middle line** have stems going **down** (on the left side)

## The Relationship

Notice the pattern:

- Each level **divides in half**

This mathematical relationship continues as we learn shorter notes (eighth notes, sixteenth notes) later.

## Counting Practice

Try this exercise on Middle C:

1. Play C as a **whole note** — count "1 — 2 — 3 — 4" (hold the key down for all 4 beats)
2. Play C as **half notes** — "1 — 2" (release), "3 — 4" (release)

At the beginning of every piece of music, you will see **two numbers stacked** at the start of the staff. This is the **time signature** — it tells you how to count.

## Reading a Time Signature

- **Top number** = how many beats per measure
- **Bottom number** = what kind of note gets one beat

## 4/4 Time (Common Time)

- **4** beats per measure
- A **quarter note** (4 = quarter) gets one beat
- This is the most common time signature in Western music
- Sometimes written as **C** (which stands for "Common time")

Count: **1 — 2 — 3 — 4 | 1 — 2 — 3 — 4 | ...**

## 3/4 Time (Waltz Time)

- **3** beats per measure
- A **quarter note** gets one beat
- Creates a "waltz" feel: **strong**-weak-weak
- Think of waltzes, many folk songs, and some ballads

Count: **1 — 2 — 3 | 1 — 2 — 3 | ...**

## Bar Lines and Measures

Vertical lines called **bar lines** divide music into **measures** (also called bars). Each measure contains exactly the number of beats specified by the time signature.

A **double bar line** marks the end of a section, and a **final bar line** (thin + thick) marks the end of the piece.

## Why It Matters

The time signature tells you the rhythmic "feel" of the music before you play a single note. Always check it first!`,

## "Ode to Joy" (Right Hand) — Beethoven

This famous melody uses only the notes in C Position (C-D-E-F-G) and is in 4/4 time. All notes are quarter notes unless marked otherwise.

### The Melody

Line 1:
**E E F G | G F E D | C C D E | E — D D —**

Line 2:
**E E F G | G F E D | C C D E | D — C C —**

The dashes indicate the note is held for 2 beats (half note).

## How to Practice

1. **Say the note names** first, without playing, while tapping the rhythm
2. **Play very slowly** — aim for about 60 BPM (1 note per second)
3. **Stop at each bar line** and check: are you using the correct fingers?
4. **Loop difficult measures** 3-5 times before moving on
5. **Connect the lines** once each is comfortable separately

## Practice Tips for Left Hand

The left hand is typically less coordinated for right-handed people. Here are specific tips:

1. **Practice each line separately** at least 5 times before connecting them
2. **Watch your ring finger (4)** — it tends to collapse or stick to the middle finger
3. **Keep your wrist level** — the left hand tends to drop or twist
4. **Match the tempo** you used for the right hand melody
5. **Do not rush** to play hands together yet — that comes in Module 2

Once you can play this melody smoothly, try playing the right hand "Ode to Joy" first, then immediately switch to the left hand "Aura Lee" without pausing. This trains your brain to switch between hands quickly.`,

        content: `Music is not just about the notes you play — it is equally about the **silence between them**. Rests tell you when **not** to play.

## Rest Values

Every note value has a corresponding rest of the same duration:

| Note | Rest Symbol | Beats of Silence |
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| Whole note | 𝄻 (hangs from line 4) | 4 beats |
| Half note | 𝄼 (sits on line 3) | 2 beats |
| Quarter note | 𝄽 (zigzag shape) | 1 beat |

## Whole Rest vs Half Rest — The Classic Confusion

These two look very similar! Here is how to tell them apart:

- **Whole rest** 𝄻 — hangs **below** the line (think: it is so heavy it sinks down). Also: "**W**hole = goes **d**own" (W looks like it hangs down)
- **Half rest** 𝄼 — sits **on top** of the line (think: it is lighter, it floats). Also: "**H**alf = **h**at on a head"

## Why Rests Matter

- Rests create **rhythm and phrasing** — music without rests sounds like a wall of sound
- You must **count through rests** just like notes — never skip or rush past them
- Rests give your hands a moment to **reposition** for the next passage
- In many styles, the rests are what create the "groove"

## Practice: Counting with Rests

Clap this rhythm (in 4/4 time):

**Clap — Clap — Rest — Clap | Rest — Clap — Clap — Rest**

Count "1-2-3-4" steadily. Clap on beats 1, 2, 4 in the first measure, and beats 2, 3 in the second. Rest means hands stay still — but keep counting!

      { type: 'text', content: `Playing with both hands simultaneously is the defining challenge of piano. Do not worry if it feels impossible at first — **everyone** struggles with this. Your brain needs time to develop independent control of each hand.

## The Golden Rule

**Never** try to play both hands together until each hand can play its part **perfectly alone**. If you cannot play the right hand from memory without looking, you are not ready for hands together.

## Starting Exercise: Mirror Motion

Both hands play the same notes at the same time (called **parallel motion**):

1. Place both hands in C Position (RH on C4-G4, LH on C3-G3)
2. Play C with both hands simultaneously (RH finger 1 + LH finger 5)
3. Play D with both hands (RH finger 2 + LH finger 4)
4. Continue up: E, F, G... then back down: G, F, E, D, C

This is the easiest way to start because both hands do the same thing.

## Practice Method: The Slow-Add Technique

1. Play RH alone 5 times, slowly
2. Play LH alone 5 times, at the same tempo
3. Play JUST the first measure with both hands — very slowly
4. Add one measure at a time
5. Never speed up until you can play it perfectly slow` },

      { type: 'text', content: `**Parallel motion** means both hands move in the same direction at the same time. In C Position, this means both hands play C-D-E-F-G together, going up, then back down.

## Why Parallel Motion First?

It is the easiest type of hands-together playing because:
- Both hands move the **same direction**
- Both hands play at the **same time**
- You only need to think about **one line** of music

## Exercise 1: C Position Parallel Scale

Both hands in C Position. Play together, slowly:

**C — D — E — F — G — F — E — D — C**

RH: 1 — 2 — 3 — 4 — 5 — 4 — 3 — 2 — 1
LH: 5 — 4 — 3 — 2 — 1 — 2 — 3 — 4 — 5

## Exercise 2: Parallel Thirds

Play notes a third apart in each hand (skip one white key):

**C+E — D+F — E+G** (ascending) then back down

This introduces playing different notes in each hand while still moving in parallel.

## Common Issues

- **One hand rushes ahead** — slow down until both stay perfectly together
- **One hand plays louder** — listen carefully and match the volume
- **Tension in shoulders** — relax! Drop your shoulders every few bars` },

    content: [
      { type: 'text', content: `**Contrary motion** means the hands move in **opposite directions** — one goes up while the other goes down. This is harder than parallel motion because each hand does something different.

## Why Learn Contrary Motion?

- It appears constantly in real piano music
- It develops **hand independence** — the core piano skill
- It strengthens the weaker connections between your brain and fingers

## Exercise: C Position Contrary Motion

Start with both thumbs on the same note area, then move outward:

RH starts on C4 going up: **C — D — E — F — G**
LH starts on C4 going down: **C — B3 — A3 — G3 — F3**

Then reverse — hands move inward back to C.

## Tips for Contrary Motion

1. **Start extremely slowly** — half the speed you think you need
2. **Focus on the thumbs** — they are the pivot point
3. **Look at both hands equally** — do not fixate on one
4. **Count out loud** — "1, 2, 3, 4" to keep hands synchronized
5. The motion should feel **symmetrical** — like opening and closing a book` },

      { type: 'text', content: `## The Dotted Half Note 𝅗𝅥.

A **dot** after any note adds **half of that note's value** to it:

- Half note = 2 beats
- Dot adds half of 2 = 1 beat
- **Dotted half note = 3 beats**

This is the most common dotted note for beginners. It fills a complete measure of **3/4 time** (waltz time).

## The Dot Rule (applies to ALL notes)

| Original note | Beats | + Dot (half the value) | Total |
| ------------- | ----- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Whole note | 4 | + 2 | 6 beats |
| Half note | 2 | + 1 | **3 beats** |
| Quarter note | 1 | + 0.5 | 1.5 beats |

## Ties

A **tie** is a curved line connecting two notes of the **same pitch**. You play the first note and **hold it** for the combined duration of both notes. Do not strike the second note.

Example: A half note (2) tied to a quarter note (1) = hold for **3 beats total**.

### Tie vs Slur

- **Tie**: connects two notes of the **same pitch** — hold the note
- **Slur**: connects notes of **different pitches** — play them legato (smoothly connected)

They look similar (both are curved lines), but ties always connect the same note.` },

      { type: 'text', content: `**Legato** (Italian for "tied" or "bound") means playing notes **smoothly connected** with no gaps between them. This is the default way to play piano — unless marked otherwise.

## How to Play Legato

The technique is simple in concept, tricky in practice:

1. Press the first key
2. Press the next key while **still holding** the first
3. Release the first key **at the exact moment** the second key goes down
4. There should be the tiniest overlap — never a gap

Think of it like walking: one foot is always on the ground before the other lifts.

## Slurs in Sheet Music

A **slur** is a curved line over or under a group of notes. It means:
- Play all the notes within the slur **legato**
- **Lift slightly** at the end of the slur before the next phrase
- The first note of a slur is often slightly emphasized
- The last note is often slightly shortened

Slurs define **musical phrases** — like sentences in speech.

## Practice: Legato Five-Finger Pattern

Play C-D-E-F-G very slowly in C Position. Listen for:
- Is there a gap between notes? (bad — practice slower)
- Can you hear both notes sounding at once? (brief overlap is correct)
- Is the volume even? (each note should be the same loudness)

    content: [
      { type: 'text', content: `**Dynamics** are the volume levels in music. They are written in Italian abbreviations and tell you how loud or soft to play.

## The Three Essential Dynamics

| Symbol | Name | Meaning | How to achieve it |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------------- |
| **p** | *piano* | Soft | Use less arm weight, lighter finger touch |
| **mf** | *mezzo forte* | Moderately loud | Natural, comfortable playing weight |
| **f** | *forte* | Loud | More arm weight, firm fingers, deeper key press |

## Important: Volume Comes from ARM WEIGHT, Not Finger Force

This is the most common beginner mistake. To play louder:
- **Do**: Let the weight of your arm drop into the keys through firm fingertips
- **Do NOT**: Press harder with your fingers while keeping your arm tense

Think of your arm as a weight hanging from your shoulder. To play loud, let more of that weight fall into the keys. To play soft, support more of the weight with your shoulder.

## Gradual Changes

- **Crescendo** (cresc. or <) — gradually get louder
- **Diminuendo** (dim. or >) — gradually get softer

These are more expressive than sudden dynamic changes and appear constantly in music.

## Practice: Dynamic Control

Play the C Position scale (C-D-E-F-G-F-E-D-C):
1. First time: all **p** (soft)
2. Second time: all **f** (loud)
3. Third time: **crescendo** from p to f going up, **diminuendo** from f to p going down

Listen to the difference. Can you make the soft notes still sound clear? Can you make the loud notes sound full without banging?` },

      { type: 'text', content: `## The Eighth Note 𝅘𝅥𝅮

An eighth note lasts **half a beat** — two eighth notes fill the space of one quarter note.

### How to Recognize Them

- Single eighth note: filled oval + stem + **one flag**
- Paired eighth notes: filled ovals + stems + **one beam** connecting them

When eighth notes appear in pairs or groups, their flags are replaced by a **beam** (a thick line connecting the stems). This makes them easier to read.

## Counting Eighth Notes

Use "and" between the beat numbers:

**"1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and"**

Written as: **1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &**

Each number AND each "and" is one eighth note.

## Mixing Quarter and Eighth Notes

This is where rhythm gets interesting:

| Beat | 1 | & | 2 | & | 3 | & | 4 | & |
| ---- | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Pattern 1 | ♩ | | ♩ | | ♫ | ♫ | ♩ | |
| Counting | 1 | | 2 | | 3 | & | 4 | |

Pattern 1 has: quarter, quarter, two eighths, quarter.

## Practice

Clap this rhythm while counting:

**1 — 2 — 3 & 4 —** (quarter, quarter, eighth-eighth, quarter)

## C Major Chord

The simplest chord, built from three notes of the C major scale:

- **C** (root) — finger 1
- **E** (third) — finger 3
- **G** (fifth) — finger 5

Play all three notes at exactly the same time. The sound should be bright, stable, and resolved — like "home."

## G7 Chord (G Dominant Seventh)

The chord that pulls you back to C:

- **G** — finger 1 (or 5 in LH)
- **B** — finger 2 (or 3 in LH)
- **D** — finger 3 (or 2 in LH)
- **F** — finger 5 (or 1 in LH)

G7 has a feeling of **tension** — it wants to resolve to C. This C → G7 → C movement is the most fundamental progression in all Western music.

- Press all notes **simultaneously** — not rolled/arpeggiated
- Use **arm weight** to push down evenly
- Keep fingers **curved and firm** — do not collapse
- Listen: are all notes equally loud? No note should stick out

A **key** defines which set of notes a piece of music uses. The **key of C major** uses only the white keys — no sharps or flats. That is why it is the easiest key to learn first.

## The C Major Scale

The C major scale is the sequence of all white keys from C to C:

**C — D — E — F — G — A — B — C**

This pattern of **whole steps and half steps** is what defines a major scale:

**W — W — H — W — W — W — H**

Where W = whole step (skip one key) and H = half step (very next key).

The two half steps occur between **E-F** and **B-C** — these are the only pairs of white keys with no black key between them.

## Key Signature

The key of C major has **no sharps and no flats** in its key signature. In sheet music, you will see an empty space between the clef and the time signature — that means C major (or its relative minor, A minor).

## Why Keys Matter

When you see "Key of C Major" at the start of a piece:
- You know the scale is C-D-E-F-G-A-B
- The primary chords are C (I), F (IV), G7 (V7)
- The "home base" note and chord is C
- No black keys are needed (unless marked with accidentals)

## The Three Primary Chords in C

| Chord | Roman numeral | Notes | Function |
| ----- | ------------- | ----- | -------- |
| **C** | I | C-E-G | Home (tonic) |
| **F** | IV | F-A-C | Departure (subdominant) |
| **G7** | V7 | G-B-D-F | Tension (dominant) |

These three chords can accompany a huge number of songs. Try playing: **C — F — G7 — C**. Hear how it creates a journey that returns home?` },

## Setting Up G Position — Right Hand

1. Move your right hand up so **finger 1 (thumb)** is on **G4**
2. Place each finger on the next white key:
   - Finger 1 → **G**
   - Finger 2 → **A**
   - Finger 3 → **B**
   - Finger 4 → **C** (C5 — one octave above Middle C)
   - Finger 5 → **D** (D5)

## New Notes: A and B

You already know C, D, E, F, G from C Position. G Position introduces:
- **A** — between G and B on the keyboard
- **B** — the white key just left of the group of 3 black keys (from above)

## On the Staff

In treble clef G Position:
| Note | Staff position |
| ---- | -------------- |
| G4 | Second line |
| A4 | Second space |
| B4 | Third line |
| C5 | Third space |
| D5 | Fourth line |

## Practice

Play the G Position five-finger pattern: **G — A — B — C — D — C — B — A — G**

Then play the C Position pattern followed immediately by the G Position pattern. Practice the **shift** — sliding your hand from one position to the other smoothly.` },

   - Finger 5 → **G**
   - Finger 4 → **A**
   - Finger 3 → **B**
   - Finger 2 → **C**
   - Finger 1 → **D**

## Bass Clef G Position

In bass clef:
| Note | Finger | Staff position |
| ---- | ------ | -------------- |
| G2 | 5 | Bottom line |
| A2 | 4 | Bottom space |
| B2 | 3 | Second line |
| C3 | 2 | Second space |
| D3 | 1 | Third line |

## Switching Between C and G Position

This is a critical skill. Practice:
1. Play C Position LH: C-D-E-F-G (5-4-3-2-1)
2. Shift to G Position: G-A-B-C-D (5-4-3-2-1)
3. Back to C Position

The shift should be smooth — lift the hand slightly, move to the new position, and place fingers without looking down. Eventually this should feel as natural as moving your hand on a keyboard while typing.

## Both Hands in G Position

Try the parallel motion exercise from Module 2, but in G Position:

**G — A — B — C — D — C — B — A — G**

RH: 1-2-3-4-5-4-3-2-1
LH: 5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5` },

      { type: 'text', content: `Now we introduce the **black keys** and the symbols that refer to them.

## Sharp (♯)

A **sharp** raises a note by one **half step** (the very next key to the right, whether black or white).

- C♯ = the black key to the right of C
- F♯ = the black key to the right of F
- E♯ = F (because E to F is already a half step — no black key between them)

## Flat (♭)

A **flat** lowers a note by one **half step** (the very next key to the left).

- B♭ = the black key to the left of B
- E♭ = the black key to the left of E
- C♭ = B (because B to C is already a half step)

## Natural (♮)

A **natural** cancels a sharp or flat, returning the note to its original white key.

## Enharmonic Equivalents

The same black key can have two names:
- C♯ = D♭ (same key!)
- F♯ = G♭ (same key!)
- G♯ = A♭ (same key!)

Which name is used depends on the musical context (the key signature).

## How Accidentals Work in Sheet Music

- An accidental applies to **that note for the rest of the measure**
- It is cancelled by a bar line (new measure = reset)
- A natural sign cancels it earlier if needed
- Key signature accidentals apply to **every occurrence** of that note throughout the piece` },

      { type: 'text', content: `Understanding **half steps** and **whole steps** is essential for scales, chords, and all of music theory. These are the two smallest building blocks of Western music.

## Half Step (Semitone)

A **half step** is the distance from one key to the **very next key** — including black keys. It is the smallest interval on the piano.

Examples:
- C to C♯ = half step
- E to F = half step (no black key between them!)
- B to C = half step (no black key between them!)

## Whole Step (Tone)

A **whole step** = two half steps. Skip one key.

Examples:
- C to D = whole step (skips C♯)
- E to F♯ = whole step (skips F)
- A to B = whole step (skips A♯/B♭)

## The Major Scale Formula

Every major scale follows the same pattern of whole and half steps:

**W — W — H — W — W — W — H**

Applied to C major:
- C →(W)→ D →(W)→ E →(H)→ F →(W)→ G →(W)→ A →(W)→ B →(H)→ C

The half steps always fall between notes **3-4** and **7-8** of the scale.

## Why This Matters

This formula lets you build a major scale starting on **any note**. Want G major? Start on G, apply W-W-H-W-W-W-H, and you get G-A-B-C-D-E-F♯-G. The F♯ is required to maintain the pattern!` },

      { type: 'text', content: `The **damper pedal** (also called the sustain pedal) is the rightmost pedal on the piano. It is the most frequently used pedal and transforms the sound of the instrument.

## What It Does

When you press the damper pedal:
1. All the **dampers** lift off the strings
2. Notes continue to ring **after you release the keys**
3. Other strings **vibrate sympathetically**, creating a richer sound
4. The overall sound becomes warmer and more connected

## When to Use It

- To connect notes that your fingers cannot reach (e.g., wide jumps)
- To create a sustained, resonant sound for slow passages
- To blend harmonies together
- To add warmth and depth to the tone

## When NOT to Use It

- Fast passages with changing harmonies — everything blurs together
- When the music requires a dry, crisp articulation
- As a crutch for bad legato technique

## Pedal Markings in Sheet Music

- **Ped.** or **⌐** = press the pedal
- ***** or **꜔** = release the pedal
- A bracket line under the staff shows pedal duration

## Your First Pedal Exercise

1. Play a C major chord (C-E-G)
2. Press the pedal **after** striking the chord
3. Release the keys — the chord keeps ringing
4. Play a G7 chord (G-B-D-F)
5. **Lift and re-press** the pedal quickly (legato pedaling)
6. The old chord clears and the new chord sustains

This lift-and-re-press technique is called **legato pedaling** and is the most important pedal skill to learn.` },

    content: [
      { type: 'text', content: `Now let us develop fluency with eighth notes by learning common patterns that appear in real music.

## Pattern 1: Steady Eighths

All eighth notes, counted evenly:

**1 & 2 & 3 & 4 &** (8 equal notes per measure)

Play C-D-E-F-G-F-E-D as steady eighth notes. Every note should be exactly the same length.

## Pattern 2: Quarter + Eighth Pairs

Alternating quarter and eighth-note pairs:

**1 — 2 & 3 — 4 &**

This is: quarter, eighth-eighth, quarter, eighth-eighth.

## Pattern 3: Pickup Eighths

Eighth notes leading into a strong beat:

**— — — & | 1 — 2 — 3 — 4 —**

The "& " before beat 1 is called an **anacrusis** or **pickup**. It creates a sense of forward momentum.

## Counting Tips

- **Never rush eighth notes** — they should be exactly half a beat, not faster
- **Tap your foot on the beat** (1, 2, 3, 4) and say "and" between taps
- The "and" should fall exactly halfway between foot taps
- If you cannot count it, you cannot play it — always count first, play second

## Common Mistake: The "Gallop"

Beginners often play eighth notes unevenly — the first eighth is long and the second is short, like a horse galloping. They should be **perfectly equal**. Record yourself and listen back to check.` },

- **6** eighth notes per measure
- An **eighth note** gets one beat

But here is the key: 6/8 does **not** feel like 6 equal beats. It feels like **2 groups of 3**:

**ONE** two three **FOUR** five six

This creates a lilting, swaying feel — think of a jig, a lullaby, or a gentle waltz.

## 6/8 vs 3/4

Both have 6 eighth notes per measure, but they feel completely different:
- **3/4**: THREE groups of TWO — **ONE** two **THREE** four **FIVE** six
- **6/8**: TWO groups of THREE — **ONE** two three **FOUR** five six

The grouping changes which beats are strong, creating a different rhythmic feel.

## Counting 6/8

Count: **1** 2 3 **4** 5 6

Beats 1 and 4 are the strong beats. Conduct it like a slow 2 — two big beats with three subdivisions each.

| ---- | --------------- |
| Dotted half note | Entire measure (6 eighth notes) |
| Dotted quarter note | Half a measure (3 eighth notes) |

## Position Shifting Exercise

Play this sequence without stopping:

1. **C Position RH**: C-D-E-F-G (quarter notes)
2. **Shift** to G Position (lift, move, place)
3. **G Position RH**: G-A-B-C-D (quarter notes)
4. **Shift** back to C Position
5. **C Position RH**: G-F-E-D-C (descending)

The shift should take **no extra time** — the music does not pause while you move. Practice the physical motion of shifting until it is automatic.

## What You Have Learned So Far

By completing Modules 0-3, you can now:
- Read treble and bass clef
- Play in two positions (C and G)
- Play hands together (parallel and contrary motion)
- Read quarter, half, whole, dotted half, and eighth notes
- Understand time signatures (4/4, 3/4, 6/8)
- Play basic chords (C, G7)
- Use dynamics (p, mf, f)
- Use the damper pedal
- Understand sharps, flats, and half/whole steps

**You are no longer a complete beginner.** Module 4 will introduce scales, key signatures, and the circle of fifths — the gateway to playing in any key.` },
